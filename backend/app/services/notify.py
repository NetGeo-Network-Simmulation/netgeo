"""Broadcast helpers: turn a store mutation into realtime bus events.

Endpoints call these after a successful create/update/delete so connected
``/ws/topology`` clients receive both the entity delta *and* a freshly recomputed
wireless plan (links + coverage) for the affected project. Recomputing server
-side — rather than trusting each client to redo the RF math — guarantees every
viewer agrees on RSSI and which links are feasible.

All helpers are best-effort and never raise into the request path: a broadcast
failure must not fail the user's POST/PATCH.
